Deviation Analysis – Overview of Findings and Conclusions
Period jan/18 to jul/24
The Jackson TN melt shop has the highest performance score in the group, being the group benchmark for 
Energy Consumption, Power on and Power Off. Even though, Jackson TN scored lower in Steel Cost 
compared to Laisa.
Wilton has the highest gap in relation to the performance score. Apparently, the main opportunities are in 
Metallic Yield, Alloy Consumption, Conversion Cost, Energy Consumption and Power On/Off, where the 
distance from the peers in the group are higher.
Overview (Score Performance x Cost)
Bring Tultitlan back to its best 
demonstrated performance levels (low 
score compared to itself), thus reflecting 
on Steel Cost score. Main focus should be 
on Metallic Yield (actuals 87.6% against 
best value in 3 consecutives months 
89.8%), being the largest financial gap in 
the group, and Energy Consumption 
(actuals 589.5 kWh/ton against best 
value in 3 consecutives months of 325.7 
kWh/ton).  For Energy Consumption refer 
to Jackson TN best practices. For Metallic 
Yield refer to Laisa best practices.

Deviation Analysis – Comparison between highest and lowest Performance Score
1.
Metallic Yield: Both plants have similar best metallic yields, with Wilton at 89.5% and Jackson TN at 90.6%. However, the current value for Wilton is 
85.6%, while for Jackson TN it's slightly higher at 89.9%. 
2.
Steel Cost: The steel cost at Wilton is higher (667.2 USD/ton) compared to Jackson TN (529.1 USD/ton). This indicates that Wilton has operating cost 
opportunity compared to Jackson TN.
3.
Raw Material Cost: Jackson TN has a lower raw material cost (374.7 USD/ton) compared to Wilton (380.5 USD/ton). 
4.
Energy Consumption: Wilton has a higher energy consumption (639 kWh/ton) compared to Jackson TN (425.5 kWh/ton). This indicates a potential area 
for improvement for Wilton in terms of energy efficiency, specially considering that there is a growth trend in consumption. It is also recommended to 
act on PowerOff which is much higher in Wilton, and which may be decreasing the performance of energy consumption.
5.
Maintenance Cost: The maintenance cost at Jackson TN is lower (28 USD/ton) compared to Wilton 48.3 USD/ton). This suggests that Jackson TN has a 
more efficient maintenance process.
6.
Potential Savings: The potential savings for Jackson TN are lower ($1.8M) compared to Wilton ($4.5M). This indicates that Wilton has a greater 
opportunity to reduce costs and increase savings. Greatly leveraged by the volume of production.

1. Metallic Yield: Manitoba had a best year metallic yield of 89.4%, while Riograndense achieved a yield of 94%. For the current result, Manitoba has 89.9% and Riograndense has 
92.1%.
2. Steel Cost: The steel cost in USD/ton was lower in Riograndense (451.2 USD/ton) compared to Manitoba (541.3 USD/ton). This shows that Riograndense is having a big impact on 
Raw Material Cost. While Manitoba is at its best 3-month value for Conversion Cost
3. Raw Material Cost: The best raw material cost in USD/ton was is lower in Riograndense (325.7 USD/ton) compared to Manitoba (352.6 USD/ton). This suggests that Manitoba 
continued with its Raw material cost practices due to low value growth over the past 24 months
4. Energy Consumption: Manitoba consumed more energy (610.8 kWh/ton) compared to Riograndense (573.7 kWh/ton), indicating potential energy efficiency improvements for 
Manitoba. 
5. Maintenance Cost: The maintenance cost in USD/ton was higher in Manitoba (37.1 USD/ton) compared to Riograndense (12.2 USD/t), the same behavior happens in the best 
values. 
6. Power On and Off: The Manitoba´s plant has power on time was 41.8 minutes per heat and the power off time was 25.5 minutes per heat. This suggests a benchmark compared to 
Riograndense which has a power off of 33.4 min/heat and power On of 12.4 min/heat

1. Metallic Yield: The Ludueña plant has a lower metallic yield (83.1%) compared to the Araçariguama plant (92.4%). Luduena also demonstrate opportunities when we compare the 
current value to best value in 3 consecutives months (86.7%)
2. Steel Cost: The steel cost at the Ludueña plant (578.2 USD/ton) is higher than at the Araçariguama plant (459 USD/ton). Although Ludueña has a lower raw material cost than 
Araçariguama. This demonstrates that Ludueña has more opportunities in physical indicators.
3. Conversion Cost: The conversion cost of the Ludueña plant is 2x higher than the value of the Araçariguama plant
4. Raw Material Cost: The raw material cost at the Ludueña plant (311.5 USD/ton) is lower than at the Araçariguama plant (357.8 USD/ton). This suggests that the Ludueña plant has a 
more cost-effective raw material sourcing strategy, It uses a scrap composition with low quality and low cost. This also has an impact on the metallic yield which is lower in Ludueña
5. Maintenance Cost: The maintenance cost at the Ludueña plant (25.5 USD/ton) is higher than at the Araçariguama plant (9.6 USD/ton). This suggests that the Ludueña plant could 
benefit from improved maintenance practices.

1. Metallic Yield: The metallic yield of the Barão de Cocais plant is currently at 87.5%, which is slightly 
lower than its best year value of 89,64%. In addition, metallic yield is between quartile 1 and quartile 2, 
demonstrating there are opportunity to increase this values .
2. Steel Cost: The current steel cost at the Barão de Cocais plant is higher (498.4 USD/t) than its best value 
in 3 consecutives months (275.5 USD/t)
3. Raw Material Cost: The raw material cost at the Barão de Cocais plant is currently higher (383.4 
USD/ton) than its best year value (216.7 USD/ton). 
4. Conversion Cost: The conversion cost at the Barão de Cocais plant is currently higher (115 USD/ton) 
than its best year value (51.1 USD/ton). This indicates a gap and a potential area for cost reduction.
5. Energy Consumption: The energy consumption at the Barão de Cocais plant is currently higher (96.3 
kWh/ton) than its best year value (63.9 kWh/ton).
6. Maintenance Cost: The maintenance cost at the Barão de Cocais plant is currently higher (11.7 
USD/ton) than its best year value (5.3 USD/ton). This indicates a potential area for cost reduction.
Overview (Score Performance x Cost)
Data suggests that Barão de Cocais Melt 
Shop when compared to itself is far from 
historical best demonstrated 
performance (Low Performance Score 
when compared to itself). Key 
recommendation is then to bring back 
the best demonstrated performance 
levels. Potential savings analysis suggests 
that main focus should be given to 
Metallic Yield where current operation is  
87.5% when Barão de Cocais already 
demonstrated performance to 88.9%. 
Secondary focus should be on Alloy 
Consumption where current operation is 
close to 24.5 lb/ton when the site already 
demonstrated performance close to 21.1 
lb/ton.

The Sahagun plant has upward trend in conversion cost and although the current value is good, there is a 
gap in energy consumption, being Sahagun has the best value to energy consumption in the Gerdau´s 
plants. Sahagun  has a greater opportunity in performance and cost.
The Charlotte plant has the downward trend in the metallic yield and upward trend in steel cost and 
conversion cost, the major opportunity showed in the results is Metallic Yield, comparing the current value 
(89%) with the best value in 3 consecutives months (91.5%)
Overview (Score Performance x Cost)
Sahagun represents the highest 
production volume in the group 5. Data 
suggests that Metallic Yield should be the 
priority – current value indicates 88.2% 
with a downward trend, but Sahagun 
demonstrated a best historical value 
close to 91.6%. Energy Consumption 
should be the secondary focus – current

Overview (Score Performance x Cost)
Data suggests that Ouro Branco’s Melt 
Shop when compared to itself is far from 
historical best demonstrated 
performance (Low Performance Score 
when compared to itself). Key 
recommendation is then to bring back 
the best demonstrated performance 
levels. Potential savings analysis suggests 
that main focus should be given to 
Metallic Yield where current operation is 
close to 86.8% when Ouro Branco 
already demonstrated performance close 
to 87.8%. Secondary focus should be on 
Lime Consumption where current 
operation is close to 218.2 lb/ton when 
the site already demonstrated 
performance close to 153 lb/ton.

Overview (Score Performance x Cost)
Data suggests that Divinopolis’ Melt 
Shop has high scores for both 
Performance and Steel Cost. When 
compared to itself there is still an 
opportunity for Divinopolis to be closer 
to its historical best demonstrated 
performance levels. Key 
recommendation is then to pursue this 
opportunity being main focus should be 
given to Metallic Yield where the last 3 
months operation are indicating a 
deviation from already demonstrated 
performance close to 83.6%. When 
observing the other KPIs not much 
attention is suggested by the data as 
Divinopolis operates close to its best.

The data went through a three-step cleansing process.
(1) Whenever relevant, false zeros (from the way the data were extracted) were replaced by empty ones, so 
as not to contaminate the analysis of means and deviations.
(2) Clearly atypical data (usually collection or recording error, values extrapolated from the limit of analysis 
via IQR were replaced by empty data, so as not to contaminate the analysis of means and deviations:
(3) Data with values above or below the indicator's threshold (e.g. yields greater than 100%, negative costs) 
were replaced by empty ones, so as not to contaminate the analysis of averages and deviations.
(4) The groups were defined according to the validation with the specialist described in the following slides 
for steelmaking and rolling mills.
(5) To calculate the current value (Last MM3), the last moving average with three values greater than zero 
was considered.
(6) To adjust for the potential gain, the rates were adjusted for present value (average of the last 3 months).
(7) All values that needed to be calculated by average followed the indicator sheets for the cumulative rules

Descriptive Analysis

*** Page 96 ***
• To calculate the performance score, first the historical average of each indicator per plant is calculated,
then the score for each indicator applying a normalization of the data where the plant with the worst
result receives 1 and the one with the best result 5. Then a weighted average of the score of each
indicator in the table below for each plant, the result is the performance score.
• To calculate the performance score, the available indicators that do not refer to cost were considered:
Lime Consumption, Electrode Consumption, Power Off, Metallic Yield and Total Energy.
• To measure the plant's performance with itself, the distance between the average of the last three
months and the best and worst value of the plant within the period of analysis is calculated for each
indicator.
• To measure the performance of the plant compared to the group, the distance between the average of
the last three months and the best value of the indicator in the group is calculated.
• The Alloy Consumption indicator was disregarded for all plants in this analysis.
• Power Off data was disregarded for the plants: 'LUD','LA','TUL','PIN','CHI','OB',’FS’,’BCOC’,’DIV’
• Total Energy data was disregarded for the plants: 'LUD','OB',’BCOC’,’DIV’
• Metallic Yield data were disregarded for the plants: 'FS', 'MON'
• For plants in the special group ('CHA', 'FSM', 'PIN', 'MON', 'FS') only data from 2021 was considered.
• The analysis also disregards values ​outside the interquartile range (IQR) for all indicators in all plants, as
they are considered outliers.

Analytics Interventions
Critical Performance KPIS
Ferro Alloy Consumption optimization: Recommend optimal 
process settings that have resulted in optimal consumption of 
Ferro alloys in the past for a specific steel grade and hot metal 
properties
Casting Speed Maximization: Recommend maximum casting 
speed basis Chemistry and Heat parameters for throughput 
improvement without impacting reliability and operator 
confidence
End Point Prediction: Predict End Point Properties 
(Temperature, Carbon & Phosphorus content) from BOF 
Process Parameters & Hot Metal Properties and Prescribe 
Operating Regimes to ensure achievement of End Point 
Properties & avoid need for Re-blows
Reduction in Caster nozzle Clogging: Recommend optimal 
setting to reduce clogging in SEN (Submerged Entry Nozzle) in 
caster to avoid downgrading of slabs caused due to resultant 
mold level fluctuations
Improved LD Gas Recovery: Track LD gas recovery of 
individual heats to highlight any instances of violation of SoP 
so that root causes of excessive LD gas flaring can be 
addressed
